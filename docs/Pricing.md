# Pricing
**Subscription Management** (platform), as well as **Stripe** (payment provider), offer pay-as-you-go pricing, based on payments you process. There are no setup fees, monthly fees, or any other hidden fees. Your final price will be calculated as a sum of transaction fees from both parties, based on your app price to your customer, as defined in the table below. 

| | Subscription Mgt. | Stripe |
|-|-|-|

Transaction fees | **7%** | **3.4%+30Â¢** ([region specific](https://stripe.com/pricing))
Both fees will be automatically applied to a transaction amount as the transaction happens. There are no fees if you need to refund a payment, but the fees on the original payment will not be returned in case of a refund.
## Volume Discount
We support our publishers with a volume-based discount program. Publishers that show a significant sale over a year will receive a discount for the platform fee for the next full year as defined in the table below.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Sales (USD)</td>
    <td>> 100,000 USD</td>
    <td>> 500,000 USD</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Transaction fee</td>
    <td><b>6% (14% discount)</b></td>
    <td><b>5% (28% discount)</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>
The anniversary date will be set with the first successful customer payment. If you have achieved one of the thresholds, the discount will then be applied automatically to all future transactions.

Stripe has its own volume-based discount program. Please [contact the Stripe sales team](https://stripe.com/en-nz/contact/sales) to get more information about it.
