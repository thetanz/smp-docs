# FAQ
## How to start using Subscription Management? 
Subscription Management is a separate extension which you use as a dependency app for each extension you would like to monetize. During the publisher onboarding process, we will provide a development version to set up your integration. When the integration is defined, we will provide an AppSource version dependency reference that needs to be used for your AppSource publication.
